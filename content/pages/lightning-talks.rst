:summary: Lightning Talk Topics: Suggestons and Proposals 
:order: 02

Lightning talks are short (~5-10 minute) presentations on small, often
beginner-friendly topics.  When possible, these talks are tacked onto the end
of our regular meetings.  Periodically we may also host a `Thunderstorm
<|filename|/posts/july-2014-recap.rst>`_, a meeting consisting entirely of
lightning talks.

Here we will maintain a list of requested topics for lightning talks.  Please
let us know if you have any topic suggestions!  Likewise, let us know if you
are interested in covering one of these topics at an upcoming meeting.
