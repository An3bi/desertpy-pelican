:summary: Oct 2014 Meeting - PyPy

When
  Wednesday **October 22nd, 2014** at **6:30PM**

Where
  Gangplank Chandler - `260s Arizona Ave, Chandler, AZ 85225 <https://www.google.com/maps?q=260+S+Arizona+Ave,+Chandler,+AZ+85225,+USA&hl=en&ll=33.299758,-111.841679&spn=0.018383,0.012252&sll=33.299774,-111.841663&sspn=0.018383,0.012252&hnear=260+S+Arizona+Ave,+Chandler,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85225&t=m&z=16>`_
  We may be in Gangplank or in the HiringSolved space next door.  Ask around.

What
  Tim will lead a brief discussion of PyPy, a Python interpreter implemented in
  Python, followed by a longer discussion of the RPython toolchain which makes
  this implementation not only possible, but faster than the standard C-Python
  interpreter. The discussion of RPython will be illustrated using a simple
  interpreter implemented in Python, which is then translated to native code
  using the RPython toolchain.

  Also, there will be Mandelbrot sets.

Who
  Tim has been using Python since way back at Python 0.9.3. He uses Python
  primarily to process and display numerical data and is very interested in
  ways of coaxing as much performance as possible from Python and its various
  numerical extensions.
