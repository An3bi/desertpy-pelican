:summary: New monthly meetings in 2014

Spring is upon us and change is in the air for DesertPy.  First off, we are
going to have monthly presentation based meetings for the rest of this year.
These meetings will be on the same day of the month as usual, the fourth
Wednesday.  Tentatively the locations will be alternating between Gangplank in
downtown Chander and the `Isos Technologies <http://www.isostech.com/>`_ office
in Tempe (just East of Rural and University behind Chompies).  Our first visit
to Isos will be next week, March 26th, when I will wow you all with a
demonstration of how I use `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_, mostly for data
analysis purposes.  Please RSVP on the `Meetup event page
<http://www.meetup.com/Phoenix-Python-Meetup-Group/events/171443982/>`_.

What does that mean for our alternate month social gatherings at `Boulders on
Broadway <http://bouldersonbroadway.com/>`_?  Well, we will have them
occasionally, most likely on the second Wednesday of the month.  The next one
is already scheduled for April 9th.  I hope to see you all there.  Well, not
all at once of course â˜º, our usual table only seats about 15.

Lastly, `Python 3.4.0 <https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/>`_ was
released this week.  In an effort to get us all up to speed, we are happy to
announce that at each meeting for the rest of the year someone will give a
lightning talk on one of the PEP's implemented by this release.  By the way,
that lucky 'someone' could be YOU!  As always we are looking for community
members to help give presentations, please contact me (Austin Godber,
godber@gmail.com) if you are interested in giving a presentation.

Looking forward to another great year!
