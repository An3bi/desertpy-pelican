:summary: DesertPy is a Phoenix Arizona Python community.

Welcome to the DesertPy website.  This is the online home of Phoenix area
Python users.  In an effort to bring together Phoenix area Pythonistas the
group maintains several online resources including the `DesertPy Meetup Group
<http://www.meetup.com/Phoenix-Python-Meetup-Group/>`_, `@desertpy on twitter
<https://twitter.com/desertpy>`_, `DesertPy on Github 
<https://github.com/desertpy>`_, the `DesertPy Google+ Community 
<https://plus.google.com/communities/103511724147602323431>`_, and a `Google
groups mail list <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/desertpy>`_.

For now, the DesertPy Github group contains the source for this website,
sources for some of the presentations given at group meetings, as well as
providing hosting for both the statically generated website and presentations
using `Github Pages <http://pages.github.com/>`_
