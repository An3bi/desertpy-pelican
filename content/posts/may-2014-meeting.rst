What
  Join DesertPy this month, back in Tempe, where Trevor will introduce the
  lightweight web framework, `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_.  Flask is a
  BSD licensed micro framework that uses `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_
  for templating  but allows you to choose the persistence layer.

  Sarah will continue our PEP talk series by telling us about PEP 450 which is
  implemented in Python 3.4 as the `statistics module 
  <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/statistics.html>`_.
