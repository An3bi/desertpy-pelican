:summary: July 2014 Recap

This month's meeting format was a series of lightning talks.  We
restricted the talks to a hard limit of 5 minutes, which was a
challenge for some of us.  Here is a quick recap with some reference
links.


+ SciPy 2014 Highlights

  Austin provided some highlights from this year's SciPy conference.
  Lots of exciting developments.  Five minutes didn't do it justice.

+ Nsq and Python

  Trevor demoed `gnsq <https://github.com/wtolson/gnsq/>`_, a gevent
  based python client for the NSQ distributed messaging platform,
  which was highlighted in this week's `PyCoder's Weekly
  <http://pycoders.com/>`_.

+ IPython as a command shell

  Ian combined two of my favorite things: `IPython and command shells
  <https://github.com/ianpreston/oh-my-py/>`_.

+ Exploring Python's Method Resolution Order (MRO)

  Jason took us from the basics of the MRO to some more complicated
  examples.  He was about to divulge how to hack the MRO at run-time
  before the 5-minute horn stopped him short.

+ Python logging for web applications

  I tried my best to walk through my `IPython Notebook
  <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/erik-stephens/6918b6c25591d2b4d93f/>`_
  demonstrating how you can use Python's logging module and
  ElasticSearch & Kibana to instrument & analyze your web
  applications.
