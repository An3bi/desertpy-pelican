:summary: Sept 2014 Meeting Follow Up

We had another great meeting in September that I didn't have a chance to
announce on this website.  Dr. Sarah Braden gave an introductory talk on
`Machine Learning with Python <http://presentations.desertpy.com/machine_learning_braden/machine_learning_braden.slides.html>`_. 
We had a great turn out which included at least a half dozen new members.
Erik shared a relevant link to the
`scikit-learn algorithm cheat-sheet <http://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.ca/2013/01/machine-learning-cheat-sheet-for-scikit.html>`_
on the `DesertPy Sub-Reddit <http://www.reddit.com/r/desertpy>`_.

Also, I'd like to thank `Isos Technology <http://www.isostech.com/>`_ for
being such a generous host again.

Refresh this webpage constantly for news of the upcoming October meeting, which
should be on October 22nd in Chandler.  Don't miss it!
