:summary: Summer 2015 Roundup - Great summer for DesertPy

Those of you following this DesertPy website might have mistakenly thought the
group had gone dormant during the summer, but nothing could be further from
the truth!  I've merely been a lazy web master.  With help from many members,
the group hosted a full day Data Science Workshop in May, we've continued
typical monthly meetings, and we started holding regular monthly group coding
meetings.

It's also worth noting that DesertPy has recently passed the 500 user milestone
on Meetup.

Thank you all for all your contributions!
