:summary: Old presentations added to website.

We now have the old presentations uploaded to the `DesertPy Presentations Page
<http://desertpy.com/pages/presentations.html>`_ on the website.  This includes
Trevor's Mongo presentation, Jerry's RaspberryPi presentation, and my
virtualenv and fabric presentations.  These presentations, and the source, for
some of them are also available on github:
https://github.com/desertpy/presentations

This reminds me of the licensing issues we are overlooking while using github.
Github is only free for open source, and it is completely my intent to share
all of our website and presentation materials under a permissive open source
license.  I am partial to the three clause MIT/BSD style licenses and that's
the route we'll probably follow.  We will also need to make sure we get
contributors to agree as well.  We will formalize this down the road.
