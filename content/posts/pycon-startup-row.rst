:summary: PyCon Startup Row Pitch Event at Techweek LA

Don Sheu has asked me to share the following information::

    Copy to circulate, PyCon Startup Row is offering early-stage
    startups using Python an opportunity to pitch before an audience
    at Techweek LA. Techweek produces events in five US cities, with
    the largest events drawing over 8000 attendees.

    November 21st, Techweek LA is turning over the Media Temple
    Stage to PyCon Startup Row to feature startups founded by
    members of the Python community.  Audrey Roy Greenfeld author
    of Two Scoops of Django will be present and is promoting the event
    to the SoCal Python community.

    Come pitch to meet investors, possible hires, and connect with
    partners and customers. There is no charge.  I have one remaining
    spot. Please email me directly at don@sheu.com or call me at
    312.880.9389. to discuss your Company.

    Warmest wishes,

    Don Sheu
